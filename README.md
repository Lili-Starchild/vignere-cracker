# vignere-cracker
This program will take a text file and encrypt it with a random key using the Vignere Cipher method.

My program, after encrypting the file, will use a system of complex mathematical equations to guess the key.
After guessing the correct key, the program will use it to decrypt the file.

My program cannot yet decipher into readable text. The output file will be in ASCII binary. The generated key file will also be binary.
In the future, this program should be able to produce human readable deciphered files.
